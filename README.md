### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I?

I am a software developer, father and owner of my own small software development company.

Over the last few years, I have been involved in many projects and topics relating to BPMN, processes and software as a service.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about BPMN, processes and automation of processes, working with Java, PHP and Ruby.

**If you need support with a project, just send me a message at andreas (at) nerdy-by-nature.biz.**
